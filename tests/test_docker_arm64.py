"""Lightweight sanity tests for the arm64 Dockerfile + publish workflow.

These tests don't run Docker or push anything — they verify the files
exist with the expected shape so a CI misconfiguration (renamed file,
missing platform, dropped step) fails fast on PR instead of at release.

Goal: docker-arm64-jetson (weight 7). Closes the 'docker run and go'
quickstart for Jetson users.
