"""Tests for the per-step expert + RTC config-time compatibility guard.

Validates the helper at ``rtc_adapter.assert_rtc_compatible_with_num_steps``
that rejects 1-NFE + RTC combinations at config-time. The math-level
singularity is documented in the research sidecar at
``reflex_context/features/03_export/per-step-expert-export_research.md``
Lens 2 FM-4/FM-6.

This test is part of gate 2 of the per-step expert ONNX export ship
sequence (gate 1 is local CPU smoke; gate 2 is this unit test; gate 3
onwards are Modal-paid).
