"""Dataset validation — pre-flight checks for LeRobot training datasets.

`reflex validate-dataset <path>` parses a LeRobot v3.0 dataset, runs a registry
of falsifiable checks (schema completeness, shape consistency, action-finite,
embodiment match, episode count, timing monotonicity), and emits a structured
report. Catches the common "trained 2 hours, then crashed because action_dim
mismatch" footgun BEFORE customers spend Modal credits on a doomed run.

Pairs with `reflex doctor` (which validates model + runtime). Together they
cover both halves of "will this dataset → model → serve work?"
