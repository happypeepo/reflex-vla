"""Rule-based failure classifier for the Curate wedge — v1.

Per the PRD, the Failure Corpus is the highest-value Tier-1 data product
($10K-$100K/dataset). This module classifies each episode by failure mode
to power buyer-side filtering ("give me 1000 grasp_miss episodes on
Franka").

7 failure modes (per `_curation/failure-classifier-v1.md`):
    grasp_miss            — gripper closed but no force feedback
    pose_error            — final state >5cm from any commanded pose
    collision             — ActionGuard tripped velocity/torque limit
    generalization_failure — episode terminated early without success
    timeout               — episode hit max_steps without success
    action_clamp          — output saturation events / clamp ratio high
    gripper_jam           — gripper position oscillating

Per the research sidecar (Lens 3 finding F3.1): ActionGuard signals are
not yet plumbed into the recorder. Detectors that depend on guard data
(collision, action_clamp, gripper_jam-secondary) degrade gracefully —
emit confidence=0.0 with evidence='action_guard_data_unavailable' when
the guard field is absent.

Submodules:
    modes      — per-mode detector functions
    primary    — primary failure-mode selection logic
    composite  — top-level classify_episode() + integration with JSONL rows
