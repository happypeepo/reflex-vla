"""VLA distillation — SnapFlow 1-step self-distillation for flow-matching VLAs.

v0.3: SnapFlow only (pi0 + pi0.5). See
https://github.com/FastCrest/reflex-vault/blob/main/reflex_vla/01_architecture/distill_SYNTHESIS.md
for the scope decision.

## What's in v0.3

- `snapflow.py` — SnapFlow loss math (flow-matching + consistency +
  zero-init target-time embedding). Unit-testable without GPU.
- `teacher_loader.py` — load teacher PyTorch policy from reflex-export
  dir; freeze + eval. (Phase B deliverable.)

## What's DEPRECATED from v0.2

- `pi_flow.py` — moved to `archive/v0.2/distill/pi_flow.py`. Scope
  decision rejected pi-Flow in favor of SnapFlow (better 1-NFE
  quality on VLAs per Luan et al. 2604.05656).
- `dmpo.py` — moved to `archive/v0.2/distill/dmpo.py`. DMPO turned out
  to be RL+MeanFlow, not knowledge distillation. Different product
  line; may return as `phase=rl` in v0.5+.

## Public API

Use `reflex finetune --phase distill` (the new CLI entry). The
trainer is selected by `distillation_method` in FinetuneConfig;
v0.3 supports only `"snapflow"`.
