"""SnapFlow — 1-step self-distillation for flow-matching VLAs.

Reimplementation from Luan et al. "SnapFlow" (arxiv 2604.05656, Apr 2026).
The paper showed 98.75% LIBERO task success at 1-NFE vs 97.75% at the
10-step teacher — i.e. distillation IMPROVED task success on pi0.5.

Code not yet public (as of 2026-04-20); reflex is the first reproducible
implementation. This module is PURE MATH + modeling — unit-testable
without GPU. Backend glue (teacher loader, dataloader, checkpoint save)
lives in `src/reflex/finetune/backends/snapflow_backend.py`.

## The three loss components

1. **Flow-matching term**: standard flow-matching MSE on velocity.
   Student matches the true analytic velocity at random time t.
2. **Consistency term**: student at target_time=1 (one-step generation)
   matches a 2-step Euler shortcut from the TEACHER. The teacher generates
   `x_t` → `x_mid` → `v_shortcut`; the student learns to produce
   `v_shortcut` directly from `x_t` in one shot.
3. **Zero-init target-time embedding**: the student adds a new learnable
   embedding for `target_time` that's initialized to produce zero output.
   At `target_time=None` it behaves identically to the teacher (normal
   velocity prediction); at `target_time=1.0` it activates the one-step
   path. This is the SnapFlow trick — one network, dual modes.

## What this module does NOT do

- No teacher loading (lerobot policy classes → `teacher_loader.py`)
- No dataloader construction (LeRobotDataset wrapping → backend)
- No checkpoint save format (lerobot `pretrained_model/` layout → backend)
- No ONNX export (handled by `reflex.exporters.monolithic` post-training)

    The student model is a COPY of the teacher, but with a new learnable
    embedding that conditions on `target_time` (the time we want to
    generate AT, distinct from `t` the interpolation point). This
    embedding is initialized to output exactly zero, so early in
    training the student behaves identically to the teacher. Over
    training, the embedding learns to produce the one-step shortcut when
    target_time=1.

    ## How it's wired into the velocity head

    Original teacher: `velocity = head(h_vlm, h_action, time_embed(t))`
    SnapFlow student: `velocity = head(h_vlm, h_action, time_embed(t) + target_time_embed(target_time))`

    When `target_time_embed` is zero-init, the student == teacher at init.
    When training drives the consistency loss down, `target_time_embed(1.0)`
    learns the shortcut-velocity offset.

    ## This class is a CONTRACT, not an implementation
