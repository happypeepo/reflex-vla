"""Load a teacher policy for SnapFlow distillation.

The teacher is a reflex-exported checkpoint (merged PyTorch, same layout
`_auto_export` consumes): `<dir>/config.json` + `model.safetensors` +
`policy_preprocessor.json` + `policy_postprocessor.json`. Distillation
student starts as a copy of the teacher, so we just load the teacher
twice and train one.

v0.3 scope: pi0 + pi0.5 only. SmolVLA lands in v0.3.1.

## What this module does

- Resolve `teacher_export` (FinetuneConfig field) → loaded nn.Module
- Freeze teacher params + set eval mode
- Infer policy_type from checkpoint config (smolvla / pi0 / pi05)
- Return both the policy + its config for the backend to wire up

## What it does NOT do

- No state-dict surgery (backend handles the student copy)
- No dataset construction (backend's responsibility)
- No velocity-function binding (backend exposes teacher.velocity_fn)
