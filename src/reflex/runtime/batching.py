"""Cost-weighted batch scheduler primitives for Reflex serve.

Per ADR 2026-04-24-chunk-budget-batching-architecture:
  - Cost budget in GPU-ms, not fixed request count
  - Profiled cost model (prewarm measurement + rolling-bucket updates)
  - Cold-start shapes fall back to a conservative constant
  - Shape-homogeneity preferred but not required — the scheduler flags
    mixed-shape batches so cuda-graphs code can decide whether to
    eager-fallback at dispatch time

Research sidecar:
  features/01_serve/subfeatures/_perf_compound/chunk-budget-batching/
  chunk-budget-batching_research.md

Composition notes:
  - `PolicyRuntime` (runtime/policy_runtime.py) owns one scheduler + one
    cost model per policy.
  - The decomposed and monolithic dispatch paths both populate the cost
    model via `record_measurement()` after each /act completes.
  - The scheduler is pure: `should_flush()` takes pending requests + a cost
    model and returns a boolean. No asyncio state inside.
